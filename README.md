This is a Cheat Sheet for Calculus 3.

-------------------------------------

For those who do not wish to try compiling this from the source, just download the PDF, it's probably reasonably up to date.

-------------------------------------

Honestly, it serves two functions, first, it is a notecard that is allowed on my tests. The other function it serves is that it is written in TeX and I have been meaining to find an excuse to learn a little bit of TeX.

I am including the TeX source to allow other people to edit it as they see fit and in particular because I couldn't seem to find any good TeX sources for the derivative and integral information.

Notes on compilation:

I am planning on including a PDF that will get updated every so often when I change the TeX Source.
To compile the cheat sheet from source, just run it in a TeX parsing engine, I use a mac and TeXShop.

DO NOT MOVE THE SOURCE FILE WITHOUT ALSO MOVING "sheet_images" !!!!

Also to be noted, I found the images by searching on google for the relevant surfaces.

unit\_circle isn't required, it's just included because I used it and it is interesting. It is not my own work, and I did include an Originally Retrieved from note at the top of unit\_circle.tex.

Also included, by popular demand, is a slightly-reformatted version that is made by "printing" both sides onto one side leaving the other side to be used for whatever. This is made by hand and is not updated from the tex document. As such, it may end up being behind the tex-generated PDF.

As of this commit, I am in the last day before finals, so this will probably be my last commit.

With all that said, have fun!
