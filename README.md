This is a Cheat Sheet for Calculus 3.

-------------------------------------

For those who do not wish to try compiling this from the source, just download the PDF, it's probably reasonably up to date.

-------------------------------------

Honestly, it serves two functions, first, it is a notecard that is allowed on my tests. The other function it serves is that it is written in TeX and I have been meaining to find an excuse to learn a little bit of TeX.

I am including the TeX source to allow other people to edit it as they see fit and in particular because I couldn't seem to find any good TeX sources for the derivative and integral information.

Notes on compilation:

I am planning on including a PDF that will get updated every so often when I change the TeX Source.
To compile the cheat sheet from source, just run it in a TeX parsing engine, I use a mac and TeXShop.
DO NOT MOVE THE SOURCE FILE WITHOUT ALSO MOVING "sheet_images" !!!!

unit_circle isn't required, it's jut included because I used it and it is interesting. It is not my own work, and I did include an Originally Retrieved from note at the top.

Notes on Updating:

I am planning on updating this as needed for my Calculus 3 class in the summer of 2015. The problem with this is that it this class will be ending in approximately 2 weeks, and thus, this project may have a very short life.

With all that said, have fun!
